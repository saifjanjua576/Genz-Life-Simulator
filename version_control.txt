What Version Control Means to Me

Version control is a method of keeping track of changes made to a
project over time. For me, it means having a safe and organized way to
manage updates in my code without losing previous work. With tools like
Git and GitHub, I can save different versions of my project, make
improvements step by step, and undo mistakes whenever needed. It also
makes collaboration easier because multiple people can work on the same
project without issues. Overall, version control gives me confidence,
structure, and professionalism in my coding workflow.
